# E03a-Dictionaries

I started off by using a function to help define inputs easier, atleast that was the intention. It made it easier to incorporate the dictionary function and the longer list of names and birthdays this way. Then, I included a list of people and birthdays that I see as having had the largest influence on me. It's then a basic print function that displays an opening message and an operating question, as well as a full list of names. After that I used an if/else to determine how the program would return information after the user has put in a name. If they enter a name that is on my chosen list, it will return their information. If not, it will return an error message of sorts, telling them to try again. This was a little harder on me, as it incorporated a lot more guessing and looking around to find a good way to do this. I ended up finding a few different similar examples that made the most sense and helped a ton.
